scene1_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWelcome and congratulations on your position as a trainee! I'll be your assistant\r\nand will help you get started with your work here.
scene1_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nAs you might already know, your task is to look at a photograph of the criminal,\r\nthen identify them from a row of suspects. Sounds easy, but it's not always\r\nthat simple.
scene1_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWe've arranged a few training sessions for all trainees. Without further ado,\r\nlet's get to work!
scene1_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of the criminal. Memorize their face well.
scene1_line5=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nIt takes a while for us to bring about the suspects to the room, so we  have to\r\nwait a while. 
scene1_line6=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWell, there they are! Can you recognize the criminal you just saw?
scene1_line7=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou can change your selection by leaning left or right with your chair, or by \r\ntilting your device.
scene1_line8=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nIf you want to change your selection to a specific direction more than once, you\r\nneed to return to the upright position before moving again. Then you can change\r\nthe selection again.
scene1_line9=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nSelect the suspect you believe to be the correct one. You can confirm the selection by\r\nleaning or tilting the device forwards.
scene1_line10right=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nJust like that, splendid work!
scene1_line10wrong=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nThis one doesn't seem to be the criminal we're looking for, try again.
scene1_line11=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWell done. You'll get a few more criminals to identify, so we can be sure you're\r\non the top of your game.

scene2_line1= ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou've done well in these training jobs, that's great! Now it's time for you to get\r\nreal jobs.
scene2_line2= ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nIn a real situation there are often more suspects than just three. In fact, there will\r\nbe at least four suspects to choose between.
scene2_line3= ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nSince you're still a trainee, you won't be tasked with the more difficult cases yet.\r\nYou'll get to have a challenge once you've proven your skills!

scene3_line1= ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nDo you know why the job of a professional snitch is considered one of the hardest\r\nparts of crime investigation?
scene3_line2= ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nIt's simple, really. The suspects often look almost identical.
scene3_line3= ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou need to be careful from now on. If you've identified the criminal based on just\r\nthe nose so far, that might not be enough anymore.

scene4_line1=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nGood morning.
scene4_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOh, chief! Good morning, sir! What are you doing in the employee break room?
scene4_line3=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nMy private coffee maker seems to be broken.
scene4_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWell, that is definitely a good reason to be here.
scene4_line5=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nAh, you must be {0}, I've heard you've done well\r\nwith your work so far.
scene4_line6=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\n{0} is one of our most promising trainees.
scene4_line7=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nHmmh, professional snitches are always needed. If you prove to be worthy, I'm willing\r\nto consider turning this trainee position into a permanent position in the force.
scene4_line8=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nI must go before my coffee gets cold. Keep up the good work.
scene4_line9=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWill do, have a good day!
scene4_line10=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWow, you've caught the attention of our police chief! Better get to work right away.

scene5_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nNow we have a peculiar case in our hands.
scene5_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nSome of the suspects have come up with hiding behind different accessories to make\r\nidentifying them harder.
scene5_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWe would make them take the glasses and fake moustaches off, but they've glued them\r\nto their faces!
scene5_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWe have someone searching the stores for some glue remover, but in the meanwhile we'll\r\nhave to deal with the accessories.
scene5_line5=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nSo do note that the criminal might try to hide behind some accessory while he's in\r\nthe row. Don't let glasses or a moustache fool you!

scene6_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nGood news!
scene6_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nI just got a message from the chief, he's offering you a full time job as\r\na professional snitch!
scene6_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nThe recent crisis with accessories must have convinced him of your capabilities.
scene6_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOnce we get over this accessory situation you'll really be able to get into the\r\nwork of a professional snitch!

scene7_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nThe glue remover and razors have done their jobs, the suspects aren't wildly\r\naccessorized anymore.
scene7_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOf course, it's merely a matter of time until they try something like that again.
scene7_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nHowever, now it's time for you to really get into the work of a professional\r\nsnitch!
scene7_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nThese new, trickier cases have five suspects. This shouldn't cause you too much trouble.
scene7_line5=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOh and… Congratulations on the permanent position in the force. It's nice to have you\r\nas a partner for good.

scene8_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nHow does it feel to work here full time?
scene8_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou haven't suffered from back or wrist pain, have you? You can take a break\r\nif you have.
scene8_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou can have a few days off too if you need it. The work isn't going anywhere\r\nand you can get back to it right where you left off.

scene9_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nI knew the criminals would try to fool us again.
scene9_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nIt's even in the exact same way as last time, do they think we're stupid?
scene9_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this time they seem to have used industrial grade epoxy and our\r\nglue remover has no effect.
scene9_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nThe work can't wait though, and you've already proven that you can identify them\r\ndespite accessories so I'm sure you can do it again.

scene10_line1=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nOh, {0}, nice to see you.
scene10_line2=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nYou know, I used to be just like you when I was young.
scene10_line3=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nFull of energy, diligence and ambition.
scene10_line4=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nYou start to feel your own age when you look at youngsters go.
scene10_line5=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nYou have a bright future in front of you when you're already this accomplished\r\nas a professional snitch.
scene10_line6=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work, who knows where it leads you.

scene11_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nWhat a strange situation!
scene11_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, all of the suspects are nearly identical.
scene11_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nEven the Beagle Boys look all different compared to these guys!
scene11_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou really need to stay sharp with these few rows of suspects.

scene12_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOh my, they all looked the same to me.
scene12_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have had any chance of finding the right criminal.
scene12_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou're really turning out to be a master among all professional snitches!
scene12_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOh yes, there were some work matters I needed to talk about with you.
scene12_line5=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nThe following cases are going to have more suspects again.
scene12_line6=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nSix suspects is the most we can fit into the room at this time, and even then some\r\nof them have to lean against the walls.
scene12_line7=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nI don't think we can fit more than this into any room we have.

scene13_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nSix suspects didn't seem to cause you any troubles.
scene13_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou've really gotten good at this job.
scene13_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nYou're making me jealous, I wish I had a memory that good.
scene13_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work.

scene14_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nIncredible, you've achieved the highest level of professional snitch there is!
scene14_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nEven Salvatore Gravano would pale in comparison.
scene14_line3=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nAnd many say he's the prime example of professional snitches.
scene14_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nNo point in slowing down now! The coming challenges may be the hardest yet, so\r\nI'm sure you'll enjoy them.

scene15_line1=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nChief, I almost didn't recognize you!
scene15_line2=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nI didn't know today was casual Friday…
scene15_line3=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing. I'm retiring.
scene15_line4=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nRetiring? So suddenly?
scene15_line5=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this for a while now. I've just been waiting for a fitting\r\ncandidate for the new police chief.
scene15_line6=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nAnd now you've found this fitting candidate?
scene15_line7=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nYes. My flight is departing shortly so I'll make this quick.
scene15_line8=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\n{0},you're now the new police chief.
scene15_line9=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOh, what a pleasant surprise!
scene15_line10=ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nOr, well, not really a surprise. {0} has proven themselves to be\r\nreliable and talented.
scene15_line11=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nMy thoughts exactly. {0}, I can leave the responsibility of\r\nthis police precinct to you without a single worry.
scene15_line12=POLICE CHIEF\r\n\r\nI must go now. Keep the flag high.
