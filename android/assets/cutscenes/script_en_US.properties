scene1_line1=ASSISTANT: Welcome and congratulations on your position as a trainee! I'll be\r\nyour assistant and will help you get started with your work here.
scene1_line2=ASSISTANT: As you might already know, your task is to look at a photograph of the\r\ncriminal, then identify them from a row of suspects. Sounds easy, but it's not always\r\nthat simple.
scene1_line3=ASSISTANT: We've arranged a few training sessions for all trainees. Without further\r\nado, let's get to work!
scene1_line4=ASSISTANT: Here is a picture of the criminal. Memorize their face well.
scene1_line5=ASSISTANT: It takes a while for us to bring about the suspects to the room, so we\r\nhave to wait a while. 
scene1_line6=ASSISTANT: Well, there they are! Can you recognize the criminal you just saw?
scene1_line7=ASSISTANT: You can change your selection by leaning left or right with your chair,\r\nor by tilting your device.
scene1_line8=ASSISTANT: If you want to change your selection to a specific direction more than\r\nonce, you need to return to the upright position before moving again. Then you can change\r\nthe selection again.
scene1_line9=ASSISTANT: Select the suspect you believe to be the correct one. You can confirm the\r\nselection by leaning or tilting the device forwards.
scene1_line10right=ASSISTANT: Just like that, splendid work!
scene1_line10wrong=ASSISTANT: This one doesn't seem to be the criminal we're looking for, try again.
scene1_line11=ASSISTANT: Well done. You'll get a few more criminals to identify, so we can be\r\nsure you're on the top of your game.

scene2_line1= ASSISTANT: You've done well in these training jobs, that's great! Now it's time for\r\nyou to get real jobs.
scene2_line2= ASSISTANT: In a real situation there are often more suspects than just three. In\r\nfact, there will be at least four suspects to choose between.
scene2_line3= ASSISTANT: Since you're still a trainee, you won't be tasked with the more difficult\r\ncases yet. You'll get to have a challenge once you've proven your skills!

scene3_line1= ASSISTANT: Do you know why the job of a professional snitch is considered one of\r\nthe hardest parts of crime investigation?
scene3_line2= ASSISTANT: It's simple, really. The suspects often look almost identical.
scene3_line3= ASSISTANT: You need to be careful from now on. If you've identified the criminal\r\nbased on just the nose so far, that might not be enough anymore.

scene4_line1=POLICE CHIEF: Good morning.
scene4_line2=ASSISTANT: Oh, chief! Good morning, sir! What are you doing in the employee break room?
scene4_line3=POLICE CHIEF: My private coffee maker seems to be broken.
scene4_line4=ASSISTANT: Well, that is definitely a good reason to be here.
scene4_line5=POLICE CHIEF: Ah, you must be {0}, I've heard you've done well\r\nwith your work so far.
scene4_line6=ASSISTANT: {0} is one of our most promising trainees.
scene4_line7=POLICE CHIEF: Hmmh, professional snitches are always needed. If you prove to be\r\nworthy, I'm willing to consider turning this trainee position into a permanent position in the force.
scene4_line8=POLICE CHIEF: I must go before my coffee gets cold. Keep up the good work.
scene4_line9=ASSISTANT: Will do, have a good day!
scene4_line10=ASSISTANT: Wow, you've caught the attention of our police chief! Better get to work\r\nright away.

scene5_line1=ASSISTANT: Now we have a peculiar case in our hands.
scene5_line2=ASSISTANT: Some of the suspects have come up with hiding behind different\r\naccessories to make identifying them harder.
scene5_line3=ASSISTANT: We would make them take the glasses and fake moustaches off, but they've\r\nglued them to their faces!
scene5_line4=ASSISTANT: We have someone searching the stores for some glue remover, but in the\r\nmeanwhile we'll have to deal with the accessories.
scene5_line5=ASSISTANT: So do note that the criminal might try to hide behind some accessory while\r\nhe's in the row. Don't let glasses or a moustache fool you!

scene6_line1=ASSISTANT: Good news!
scene6_line2=ASSISTANT: I just got a message from the chief, he's offering you a full time job as\r\na professional snitch!
scene6_line3=ASSISTANT: The recent crisis with accessories must have convinced him of your\r\ncapabilities.
scene6_line4=ASSISTANT: Once we get over this accessory situation you'll really be able to get\r\ninto the work of a professional snitch!

scene7_line1=ASSISTANT: The glue remover and razors have done their jobs, the suspects aren't\r\nwildly accessorized anymore.
scene7_line2=ASSISTANT: Of course, it's merely a matter of time until they try something like\r\nthat again.
scene7_line3=ASSISTANT: However, now it's time for you to really get into the work of\r\na professional snitch!
scene7_line4=ASSISTANT: These new, trickier cases have five suspects. This shouldn't cause you\r\ntoo much trouble.
scene7_line5=ASSISTANT: Oh and… Congratulations on the permanent position in the force. It's\r\nnice to have you as a partner for good.

scene8_line1=ASSISTANT: How does it feel to work here full time?
scene8_line2=ASSISTANT: You haven't suffered from back or wrist pain, have you? You can take\r\na break if you have.
scene8_line3=ASSISTANT: You can have a few days off too if you need it. The work isn't going\r\nanywhere and you can get back to it right where you left off.

scene9_line1=ASSISTANT: I knew the criminals would try to fool us again.
scene9_line2=ASSISTANT: It's even in the exact same way as last time, do they think we're stupid?
scene9_line3=ASSISTANT: Unfortunately, this time they seem to have used industrial grade epoxy\r\nand our glue remover has no effect.
scene9_line4=ASSISTANT: The work can't wait though, and you've already proven that you can identify\r\nthem despite accessories so I'm sure you can do it again.

scene10_line1=POLICE CHIEF: Oh, {0}, nice to see you.
scene10_line2=POLICE CHIEF: You know, I used to be just like you when I was young.
scene10_line3=POLICE CHIEF: Full of energy, diligence and ambition.
scene10_line4=POLICE CHIEF: You start to feel your own age when you look at youngsters go.
scene10_line5=POLICE CHIEF: You have a bright future in front of you when you're already this\r\naccomplished as a professional snitch.
scene10_line6=POLICE CHIEF: Keep up the good work, who knows where it leads you.

scene11_line1=ASSISTANT: What a strange situation!
scene11_line2=ASSISTANT: For whatever reason, all of the suspects are nearly identical.
scene11_line3=ASSISTANT: Even the Beagle Boys look all different compared to these guys!
scene11_line4=ASSISTANT: You really need to stay sharp with these few rows of suspects.

scene12_line1=ASSISTANT: Oh my, they all looked the same to me.
scene12_line2=ASSISTANT: I wouldn't have had any chance of finding the right criminal.
scene12_line3=ASSISTANT: You're really turning out to be a master among all professional snitches!
scene12_line4=ASSISTANT: Oh yes, there were some work matters I needed to talk about with you.
scene12_line5=ASSISTANT: The following cases are going to have more suspects again.
scene12_line6=ASSISTANT: Six suspects is the most we can fit into the room at this time, and\r\neven then some of them have to lean against the walls.
scene12_line7=ASSISTANT: I don't think we can fit more than this into any room we have.

scene13_line1=ASSISTANT: Six suspects didn't seem to cause you any troubles.
scene13_line2=ASSISTANT: You've really gotten good at this job.
scene13_line3=ASSISTANT: You're making me jealous, I wish I had a memory that good.
scene13_line4=ASSISTANT: Keep up the good work.

scene14_line1=ASSISTANT: Incredible, you've achieved the highest level of professional snitch\r\nthere is!
scene14_line2=ASSISTANT: Even Salvatore Gravano would pale in comparison.
scene14_line3=ASSISTANT: And many say he's the prime example of professional snitches.
scene14_line4=ASSISTANT: No point in slowing down now! The coming challenges may be the hardest\r\nyet, so I'm sure you'll enjoy them.

scene15_line1=ASSISTANT: Chief, I almost didn't recognize you!
scene15_line2=ASSISTANT: I didn't know today was casual Friday…
scene15_line3=POLICE CHIEF: There is no such thing. I'm retiring.
scene15_line4=ASSISTANT: Retiring? So suddenly?
scene15_line5=POLICE CHIEF: I've been thinking about this for a while now. I've just been waiting\r\nfor a fitting candidate for the new police chief.
scene15_line6=ASSISTANT: And now you've found this fitting candidate?
scene15_line7=POLICE CHIEF: Yes. My flight is departing shortly so I'll make this quick.
scene15_line8=POLICE CHIEF: {0},you're now the new police chief.
scene15_line9=ASSISTANT: Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
scene15_line10=ASSISTANT: Or, well, not really a surprise. {0} has proven\r\nthemselves to be reliable and talented.
scene15_line11=POLICE CHIEF: My thoughts exactly. {0}, I can leave the\r\nresponsibility of this police precinct to you without a single worry.
scene15_line12=POLICE CHIEF: I must go now. Keep the flag high.
